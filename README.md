## Introduction

This project performs demand forecasting by analyzing a historical sales dataset. It involves various stages including data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns, and model development using machine learning techniques to predict future sales demand.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. It contains sales data that includes store and item information along with the date and sales quantities. The goal is to use this data to forecast future demand for each item in the inventory.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/demand-forecasting.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd demand-forecasting
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed**:
   If not already installed, you can do so with:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
5. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. **Download the dataset**:
   Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `input` folder as specified in the notebook.

## Usage

1. **Open the notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `CODE.ipynb` file.
2. **Run the cells**:
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build forecasting models.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The project includes steps for loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and transforming the data for better model performance.
4. **Model Training and Prediction**:
   - The notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning models to predict future sales demand.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the raw dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses visualizations and statistical methods to uncover trends.
- **Demand Forecasting Models**: Builds predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast future demand.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
